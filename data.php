You end up with a big tangled mess if you are not very careful about how you make those changes. If youâve ever worked on an application where you were afraid to make changes for fear of breaking something, then you have run into technical debt. Technical debt can be dealt with via ruthless refactoring and wrapping your application in tests that poke and prod at the edge cases that your application deals with. But there is another type of debt you end up dealing with. One that is even more difficult to deal with and change. I call it infrastructure debt. Infrastructure debt is debt that you build up because you have not been paying attention to the process of creating the environments your application will exist in and have not been paying attention to the process of how your code gets from development into production. In my opinion, infrastructure debt is much more difficult to âpay offâ than technical debt. Why? It is often very difficult for people to understand that it even exists.
