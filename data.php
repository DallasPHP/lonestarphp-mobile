I am a PHP developer\n2. I like building small things\n3. I want less code, not more\n4. I like simple, readable code\nThe thing is, this stuff really isn't specific to PHP. In this talk I'll extend the concepts to other languages we work with in web development, establishing these core principles:\n- Learn languages, not frameworks\n- Build small things\n- Less code is better than more\n- Create and use simple, readable code\nWe'll cover how following these principles makes you a better developer, and makes the job of maintaining and verifying your code much easier.",

We’ll cover:\n- Using frameworks: We used to avoid them like the plague. Is that still true?\n- Scaling principles: In the good old days it was all master-slave replication and memcache. Will that still work? What else can we do?\n- Security: Is it still good enough to use magic quotes? (Hint: No.) What should you be doing instead?\n- Application architectures: Can you still just store everything in MySQL? When is a NoSQL data store a best practice? What about queues?\n- Language changes: In 2000 namespaces weren’t even on the radar. Do we really need all this new stuff that’s in PHP 5.3 and 5.4? What is it good for?\n- I heard PHP is dead and we should all just switch to Python or Ruby. Is that true?",
